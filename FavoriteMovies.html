<!--Project 41 - My Favourite Movies

 What is this? Isn't this supposed to only be Python?

Well yes, you are correct about that. For a couple projects, I'm going to sidetrack off of Python
So that I can learn the wonders that is HTML/CSS/JS (i already learned JavaScript, but a refresher is always very cool!)

Then, I believe i'm going to go on and learn the implications of Python in Web Dev.


P.S: This is my favorite movies by 12/15/24, and I'm sure that's going to change with the new Avatar 3 movie coming out
