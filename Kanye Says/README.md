# 🐻 Kanye Says — Tkinter Quote App

**Day 33 — README GENERATED BY AI**

A fun Python GUI application that displays a **random Kanye West quote** every time you click the Kanye button.
Built using **Tkinter** for the user interface and the public **kanye.rest API** for fetching quotes.

---

## 📌 Features

* 🎨 **Simple, clean GUI** made with Tkinter
* ⚡ **Fetches real-time Kanye quotes** using the Kanye REST API
* 🖱️ **Click the Kanye button** to load a brand-new quote
* 🖼️ Includes custom background + Kanye image for personality
* 🧪 Great practice for:

  * Working with APIs
  * JSON data parsing
  * GUI development
  * Event-driven programming

## 📁 Files Required

Make sure the following files are in the same directory as your Python script:

```
main.py
background.png
kanye.png
```

Your folder structure should look like:

```
📂 KanyeSays/
│── main.py
│── background.png
│── kanye.png
│── README.md  ← (this file)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. API Request

When the user clicks the Kanye button, the app sends an HTTP GET request:

```python
requests.get(url="https://api.kanye.rest")
```

The API returns JSON like:

```json
{ "quote": "I feel like I'm too busy writing history to read it." }
```

The app extracts the `"quote"` field and displays it on the canvas.

---

### 2. Updating the Quote on the Canvas

Tkinter’s `itemconfig()` method updates the existing text element:

```python
canvas.itemconfig(quote_text, text=new_quote)
```

This means the window does **not** refresh or redraw — it updates instantly.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the App

1. Install Python 3.
2. Install dependencies (only `requests` is needed):

```bash
pip install requests
```

3. Place `background.png` and `kanye.png` in the same folder.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 💡 Possible Enhancements (Optional)

* Add animation or fade-in effects for quotes
* Change fonts or styling
* Add a button to copy quotes to clipboard
* Save favorite quotes to a local file
* Add a counter showing how many quotes you’ve viewed

If you'd like, I can also create:

* A **fancier version** of this README
* An **ASCII art title**
* A **screenshot section**
* A **GUI upgrade** with better fonts/buttons

Just tell me!
