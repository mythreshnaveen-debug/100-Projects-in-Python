# Day/Project 29 - Password Manager 🔐

(README made by AI)

(not to be confused with the Password Generator, but the ```generatePassword()``` function actually was made using the code from the Password Generator.)

A simple **desktop Password Manager** built with **Python and Tkinter** that generates strong random passwords and securely stores login credentials in a local text file.

This project focuses on practicing:
- GUI development with Tkinter  
- File handling in Python  
- Random password generation  
- User input validation and feedback
