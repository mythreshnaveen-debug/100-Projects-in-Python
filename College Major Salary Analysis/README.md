# 📊 Project 72 — College Major Salary Analysis (Pandas)

> **README GENERATED BY AI**

## 📌 Overview

Project 72 is a data analysis script built with **Python** and **pandas** that explores salary trends across different undergraduate majors.
Using a CSV dataset, the program identifies:

* Majors with the **highest and lowest starting salaries**
* Majors with the **highest mid-career salaries**
* **Low-risk majors** (small salary spread over time)
* **High-potential majors** (large salary growth over time)

This project focuses on practical data cleaning, analysis, and ranking techniques using pandas.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **pandas**

---

## 📂 Dataset Requirements

The script expects a file named **`data.csv`** in the same directory.

Required columns:

* `Undergraduate Major`
* `Starting Median Salary`
* `Mid-Career Median Salary`
* `Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary`

Any rows containing missing values are automatically removed before analysis.

---

## 📈 What the Script Does

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Loads the CSV file
* Removes rows with missing data (`dropna()`)

### 2. Salary Insights

* Finds the **highest starting median salary**
* Finds the **highest mid-career median salary**
* Finds the **lowest starting median salary**

### 3. Risk vs Reward Analysis

* Calculates a **Spread** value:

  ```
  Spread = Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary − Starting Median Salary
  ```
* Uses this spread to determine:

  * **Top 5 Lowest Risk Majors** (smallest spread)
  * **Top 5 Highest Potential Majors** (largest spread)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install pandas if you don’t have it:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
2. Make sure `data.csv` is in the same folder as the script.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📤 Output

The program prints a clear, readable summary directly to the console, showing:

* Major names
* Salary values
* Salary change potential

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

* CSV data handling with pandas
* Data cleaning (`dropna`)
* Index-based analysis (`idxmax`, `idxmin`)
* Sorting and ranking datasets
* Real-world data insights using Python

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Visualizations using **matplotlib** or **seaborn**
* Export results to a CSV or JSON file
* Interactive CLI options
* Salary normalization for inflation
