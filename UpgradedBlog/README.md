## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure Python is installed, then install Flask and Requests:

```bash
pip install flask requests
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

Flask will start a local development server in debug mode.

---

### 3️⃣ Open in Browser

Visit:

## 🧠 How It Works

### `main.py`

* Fetches blog data from:

  ```
  https://api.npoint.io/ed8fac99f5ee10634689
  ```

* Routes:

  * `/` → Renders `index.html` with all posts
  * `/posts/<id>` → Renders `post.html` for a specific post ID; shows `error.html` if not found
  * `/about.html` and `/contact.html` → Renders corresponding static pages
  * Any other route → `error.html` (custom 404 page)

---

### `index.html`

* Loops through all posts and displays:

  * Title
  * Subtitle
  * Author & date
  * "View Post" button linking to `/posts/<id>`

---

### `post.html`

* Displays a single blog post:

  * Title
  * Subtitle
  * Author & date
  * Full post content

---

### `about.html` & `contact.html`

* About page with author info and description
* Contact page with a functional SB Forms contact form
* Both pages use consistent navigation and footer components

---

### `error.html`

* Custom 404 page with message and a "Return Home" button
* Matches the blog’s aesthetic and branding

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Runs in **debug mode** for development
* Blog data is read-only and fetched from the API on each server start
* No database is required
* External assets include Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

This project helps you practice:

* Flask routing with dynamic URLs
* Jinja2 templating for dynamic pages
* Integrating external APIs in Python
* Responsive web design with Bootstrap
* Handling 404 errors gracefully

## ✅ Changes from Previous Blog Project

Compared to **NewGen Blogs**, Dawn Blogs introduces:

* **Additional pages**: `about.html` and `contact.html`
* **Custom 404 page** (`error.html`)
* **Improved routing**:

  * Supports `/posts/<id>` for individual posts
  * Handles arbitrary routes dynamically
* **Better front-end integration** with Bootstrap and Font Awesome
* **Static assets management** (CSS, images, favicon)
* Overall more polished, user-friendly interface and branding
