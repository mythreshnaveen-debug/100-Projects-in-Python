# Project 30 - QuickNotes 📝

QuickNotes is a **desktop note storage and search application** built with **Python and Tkinter** that allows users to **save, organize, and instantly retrieve notes** using a JSON-based backend.

This project expands on the concepts and structure from **Project 29** (Password Manager) and reuses its core GUI + file-handling logic with a new purpose and data model.
