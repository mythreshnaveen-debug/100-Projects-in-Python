## What this project is

This is a single-page static site that shows a motivational poster (image, heading and short caption). It demonstrates basic HTML and CSS layout and styling.

## Key features / assignment requirements

- Uses the Libre Baskerville font for the main heading (the project includes a link to Google Fonts in `index.html`).
- White text on a black background.
- The poster content (image, heading and paragraph) is placed inside a containing `div` and centered on the page.
- The image has a 5px white border.
- The container is centered horizontally using width 50% and `margin-left: 25%` (so the image set to `width: 100%` fills the container).
- The `h1` is styled to be uppercase using `text-transform: uppercase`.

## Files

- `index.html` — main page (contains the poster markup).
- `style.css` — project stylesheet used by `index.html`.
- `assets/images/` — image(s) used by the poster. Replace the image file inside this folder to change the poster picture.
- `solution/` — contains an example/solution version (`solution.html`, `solution.css`) and its own `assets/images`.

## How to view

1. Open `index.html` in your browser. The simplest way is to double-click the file in your file explorer.
2. Or from PowerShell in this project folder you can run:

```powershell
Start-Process .\index.html
```

This will open the page in your default browser.

## How to change the image

1. Put your image file inside `assets/images/`.
2. Update the `src` attribute of the `<image>` tag in `index.html` (for example `assets/images/your-image.jpg`).
3. The stylesheet already sets the image to fill the container; use images with a decent resolution so they look sharp.

## Notes / improvements

- The `index.html` currently uses a `link rel="preconnect"` to the Google Fonts specimen page — to properly load the font in production you can replace it with the standard Google Fonts embed link, for example:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Libre+Baskerville:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

- If you want to serve this over HTTP during development, run a small static server (for example using `npx http-server` or Python's `python -m http.server`) and open `http://localhost:PORT`.
