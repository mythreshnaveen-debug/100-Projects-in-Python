| `/`         | GET       | Home page                          |
| `/register` | GET, POST | Register a new user                |
| `/login`    | GET, POST | User login                         |
| `/secrets`  | GET       | Protected page (login required)    |
| `/logout`   | GET       | Logout user                        |
| `/download` | GET       | Download file from `static/files/` |

## Security

* Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 SHA-256 with salt.
* Protected routes require login (`@login_required`).
* User sessions are securely managed with Flask-Login.

## Notes

* The database `users.db` is automatically created on first run.
* The `SECRET_KEY` is randomly generated; for production, use a fixed secret key in environment variables.
* The project is designed for learning and can be extended with email verification, password reset, and deployment features.

## Future Enhancements

* Email verification and password reset
* Environment variable configuration for security
* Deployment to cloud platforms (Heroku, Render)
* Unit testing for authentication flows
