# Project 24 - Mail Merge
This Project is to create a birthday party invitation to everyone on the Birthday Party list.
## Why is there so much folders?
In the Udemy Course, they made us create all these folders, to challenge us with relative and absolute file paths.
## Can I adapt this to work with any letter?
Yeah of course! All you need to do, is add [name] to where the name should be in /Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt, and you will be good! Also, make sure to update the names.
