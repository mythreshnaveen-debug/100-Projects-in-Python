# Day 34 - Quizzler — True/False Trivia Quiz (Tkinter)

*A simple GUI quiz app that pulls **True/False** questions from an online API and lets you answer them in a clean interface.*

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a Python quiz application built with **Tkinter** and **requests**.  
When you run it, the app:

- Fetches **10 random True/False questions** from the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) API  
- Displays one question at a time in a **Tkinter window**  
- Lets you answer using ✅ True / ❌ False buttons  
- Keeps track of your **current score**  
- Shows a **completion message** when you finish the quiz

It’s a great example of combining:

- API calls  
- Object-oriented design (`Question`, `QuizBrain`, `QuizInterface`)  
- A graphical UI with Tkinter

## 🗂 Project Structure

```text
.
├── main.py           # Entry point: fetches questions and starts the quiz
├── ui.py             # Tkinter UI: QuizInterface class, buttons, labels, canvas
├── question_model.py # Question class (models a single question)
├── quiz_brain.py     # QuizBrain class (quiz logic, scoring, question flow)
└── images/
    ├── true.png      # True button image
    └── false.png     # False button image
````

> Note: Only `main.py` and `ui.py` are shown here, but `question_model.py` and `quiz_brain.py` are small helper modules.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.10+ (earlier versions likely fine too)
* The following Python packages:

  * `requests` (for the API call)
  * `tkinter` (comes with most Python installations)

Install `requests` with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

You’ll also need:

* `images/true.png`
* `images/false.png`

in an `images` folder next to your `.py` files.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure the project files are in the same folder:

   ```text
   main.py
   ui.py
   question_model.py
   quiz_brain.py
   /images
      ├── true.png
      └── false.png
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. A window titled **“Quizzler”** should appear.

## 🧩 How It Works (High-Level)

### `main.py`

* Calls the Open Trivia DB API:

  ```python
  question_data = requests.get(
      url="https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=boolean"
  ).json()["results"]
  ```

* Builds a `question_bank` list of `Question` objects.

* Creates a `QuizBrain` instance to handle quiz logic.

* Passes `QuizBrain` into `QuizInterface` to start the GUI.

* (There’s also a CLI-style `while quiz.still_has_questions()` loop at the bottom, but the GUI handles most of the interaction now.)

### `ui.py` — `QuizInterface`

* Sets up the Tkinter window:

  * Title: `"Quizzler"`
  * Background color: `THEME_COLOR = "#375362"`
  * Score label in the top-right
  * Canvas in the center to display the question text
  * Two image buttons:

    * ✅ True (`true.png`)
    * ❌ False (`false.png`)

* Calls `self.get_next_question()` to load the first question.

* When you click a button, it calls:

  ```python
  self.check_answer(True)  # or False
  ```

* Uses methods on the `QuizBrain` instance (like `next_question()` and `check_answer(...)`) to:

  * Move to the next question
  * Update the score
  * Detect when the quiz is finished

---

## ✅ Features

* Fetches **live questions** from an online trivia API
* Simple, intuitive **True/False** interface
* Score tracking in the UI
* End-of-quiz message when you finish all 10 questions
* Clean separation of:

  * Data model (`Question`)
  * Logic (`QuizBrain`)
  * UI (`QuizInterface`)

---

## 💡 Possible Improvements

Some ideas if you want to expand this project later:

* Add a **difficulty selector** (easy/medium/hard) using the API’s parameters
* Let the user pick **number of questions**
* Show **feedback colors** (e.g., green for correct, red for wrong) for a second before moving on
* Add categories (e.g., film, science, history)
* Store **high scores** in a local file (e.g., JSON or text)
* Add a “Play Again” button when the quiz ends

## 🧾 Notes

* This project was written in Python and uses Tkinter for the GUI.
* Trivia data is provided by the Open Trivia Database (`https://opentdb.com/api_config.php`).
* README GENERATED BY AI
* This was actually a modified version of 'The Quiz' Project from a while back. The most notable differences are the tkinter UI, and the custom data from the Open Trivia Database.
