# Project 74 – Analyzing LEGO Sets 🧱

## Overview

This project explores a comprehensive LEGO dataset to uncover trends in LEGO’s history, product growth, and set complexity over time. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the notebook answers questions about LEGO’s origins, themes, and how sets have evolved across decades.

The analysis focuses on understanding both **historical context** and **quantitative patterns** in LEGO set production.

---

## Key Questions Explored

* What is the **largest LEGO set ever created**, and how many parts does it contain?
* In what year did LEGO begin selling sets, and **how many sets were sold in its first year**?
* Which **LEGO theme** contains the most sets?
* How has LEGO’s **product offering expanded** over time?
* Have LEGO sets become **larger and more complex** as the years progressed?

---

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project comes from **Rebrickable**, a community-driven LEGO database that provides detailed CSV files on:

* LEGO sets
* Themes
* Parts
* Release years

Source: Rebrickable LEGO Downloads

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation and aggregation
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Project Structure

* Data importing and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Grouping and aggregation by year and theme
* Visualization of trends over time
* Interpretation of results

---

## How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
2. Ensure required libraries are installed:

   * `pandas`
   * `matplotlib`
3. Run cells from top to bottom

---

## Notes

* This project is intended for **educational and analytical purposes**.
* Results depend on the completeness and accuracy of the Rebrickable dataset.
